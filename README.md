## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This project analyzes the data from the US Department of Transportation on consumer airfare.  The data and reports are updated quarterly and the table used in this project is Table 6.  The data set can be found at https://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/domestic-airline-consumer-airfare-report.  The data is organized by quarter, and lists every major city-pair and the fares and passengers between the cities.  The data on the city-pair does not indicate the direction traveled.

At the moment, the plots derived from the dataset are as follows:
- A look at the distribution of passenger volume among all the city-pairs
- A look at fares and how trip distance affects them
- A view of the top revenue generating routes, by year

I used Jupyter Notebook to clean and fix the data, then plotted the charts in Streamlit. The final product is deployed on Render, and can be seen here:
